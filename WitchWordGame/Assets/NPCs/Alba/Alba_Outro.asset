    text: Very much, indeed. Not only at your apparent magical aptitude, but it seemed
      a portent of the excellence we are to expect from you in the future. I am very
      proud to have been your teacher, and am prouder still to welcome you as a colleague.
      Well done, Irma, consider yourself graduated. Consider yourself a fully realized
      witch.
